    "In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become crucial channels for customers to express their opinions about brands and products.

This project aims to analyze tweets directed at various tech brands and products during the SXSW (South by Southwest) conference to understand customer sentiment patterns. By doing so, companies can gain real-time feedback about their products and competitors, enabling data-driven decision making.\n",
